**Design Movement**: **Biophilic Brutalism**

**Core Principles**:
1. **Raw & Refined**: Contrast raw, earthy textures (stone, paper, grain) with refined, elegant typography and layout.
2. **Rhythm of Nature**: Visual elements should mimic natural rhythms—flowing lines, organic shapes, and breathing animations.
3. **Immersive Depth**: Use layering, parallax, and depth to create a sense of immersion, like stepping into a forest.
4. **Honest Materiality**: Digital elements should feel tactile and grounded, avoiding overly glossy or synthetic aesthetics.

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Base**: Deep Forest Green (`#0a1f14`) and Earthy Charcoal (`#1a1a1a`) for grounding.
- **Accent**: Terracotta (`#c75b39`) and Moss Green (`#6b8c42`) for vitality.
- **Highlight**: Soft Sand (`#e6e2d3`) and Warm Sunlight (`#f4e9c9`) for warmth and readability.
- **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of being deep in nature—grounded, calm, yet alive. Darker tones reduce eye strain (digital detox), while warm accents provide comfort.

**Layout Paradigm**:
- **Asymmetric Balance**: Move away from centered grids. Use off-center compositions to guide the eye naturally, like a trail through the woods.
- **Overlapping Layers**: Content sections overlap slightly to create continuity and flow, rather than hard separations.
- **Vertical Rhythm**: Use varying vertical spacing to mimic the natural pauses in breath or music.

**Signature Elements**:
- **Organic Borders**: Soft, uneven edges for images and containers, inspired by torn paper or natural terrain.
- **Grain & Texture**: Subtle noise overlays to soften the digital sharpness.
- **Botanical Illustrations**: Line-art illustrations of local flora (ferns, leaves) used as background elements or dividers.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- **Slow & Deliberate**: Hover effects and transitions should be slow and smooth, encouraging a slower pace of browsing.
- **Magnetic Pull**: subtle magnetic effects on buttons to feel tactile.
- **Scroll-Triggered Growth**: Elements "grow" or fade in naturally as you scroll, like plants unfurling.

**Animation**:
- **Breathing UI**: Key elements (like the hero CTA) have a subtle, rhythmic pulse (expansion/contraction) matching a 7.83Hz frequency (Schumann Resonance).
- **Parallax Scroll**: Background layers move slower than foreground content to create depth.
- **Fade & Rise**: Content enters with a gentle upward float and fade-in.

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: **Cormorant Garamond** (Serif) - Elegant, expressive, and organic. Used for titles and key statements.
- **Body**: **Satoshi** (Sans-Serif) - Clean, modern, and highly readable, but with a geometric touch that balances the serif.
- **Accents**: **Kaushan Script** (Handwritten) - Used sparingly for personal notes or emphasis, adding a human touch.

**Design Movement**: **Ethereal Minimalism**

**Core Principles**:
1. **Light & Air**: The design should feel weightless, spacious, and filled with light.
2. **Clarity & Focus**: Remove all non-essential elements. Focus entirely on the message and the imagery.
3. **Fluidity**: Everything should flow like water. No hard stops or jarring transitions.
4. **Serene Precision**: Every pixel is placed with intention. The layout is mathematically balanced but feels effortless.

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Base**: Soft Mist (`#f0f4f8`) and Pure White (`#ffffff`).
- **Accent**: Pale Sage (`#a3b18a`) and Muted Lavender (`#d4c1ec`).
- **Text**: Dark Slate (`#2f3e46`) instead of black for softer contrast.
- **Intent**: To create a sense of mental clarity and peace. Light colors reflect the "cleansing" aspect of the retreats.

**Layout Paradigm**:
- **Generous Whitespace**: Extreme margins and padding. Content breathes.
- **Split Screen**: Vertical split layouts for storytelling (image on one side, text on the other) that alternate.
- **Sticky Scrolling**: Sections snap gently into place, creating a focused reading experience.

**Signature Elements**:
- **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects for cards and navigation to maintain lightness while adding depth.
- **Thin Lines**: Ultra-thin 1px lines for dividers and borders, elegant and precise.
- **Soft Shadows**: Large, diffuse shadows that make elements float.

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- **Effortless Gliding**: Interactions should feel frictionless.
- **Hover Lifts**: Cards gently lift up on hover.
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle color shifts or icon animations on interaction.

**Animation**:
- **Blur Reveal**: Images and text reveal from a blur, sharpening into focus (metaphor for clarity).
- **Smooth Scroll**: Inertia-based scrolling for a fluid feel.
- **Water Ripple**: Subtle ripple effects on clicks or key interactions.

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: **Tenor Sans** (Humanist Sans) - Open, friendly, and sophisticated.
- **Body**: **Mulish** (Sans-Serif) - Minimalist and highly legible.
- **Hierarchy**: Distinction created through size and spacing rather than weight.

**Design Movement**: **Modern Mysticism**

**Core Principles**:
1. **Ancient Wisdom, Modern Tech**: Blending sacred geometry and ancient symbols with cutting-edge web GL effects.
2. **Dark Mode First**: A deep, immersive dark mode that feels like a sanctuary or a night sky.
3. **Vibrational Resonance**: Visuals that imply sound, vibration, and energy frequencies (7.83Hz).
4. **Golden Ratio**: Layouts strictly adhering to the golden ratio for subconscious harmony.

**Color Philosophy**:
- **Base**: Deep Void Black (`#050505`) and Midnight Blue (`#0a0e17`).
- **Accent**: Electric Indigo (`#4cc9f0`) and Neon Teal (`#4895ef`) for energy points.
- **Gold**: Muted Gold (`#d4af37`) for sacred elements.
- **Intent**: To evoke the mystery of the universe and the scientific/spiritual blend of the 7.83Hz frequency.

**Layout Paradigm**:
- **Radial Layouts**: Elements radiating from a center point.
- **Grid Breaking**: Elements breaking out of the grid to suggest energy flow.
- **Fullscreen Immersives**: Full-screen video backgrounds and large typography.

**Signature Elements**:
- **Geometric Overlays**: Thin lines forming geometric patterns (flower of life, metatron's cube) as subtle backgrounds.
- **Glowing Edges**: Soft glows around active elements.
- **Data Visualization**: Abstract visualizations of "energy" or "frequency".

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- **Reactive Cursor**: A custom cursor that interacts with the background (e.g., disturbing particles).
- **Sound-Reactive**: Visuals that pulse to a background ambient track (optional).
- **Deep Hover**: Hovering reveals hidden layers or information.

**Animation**:
- **Particle Effects**: Background particles drifting and connecting.
- **Glitch/Distortion**: Very subtle, organic distortion effects on transitions to suggest frequency shifts.
- **Geometric Unfolding**: Menus and cards unfold geometrically.

**Typography System**:
- **Headings**: **Cinzel** (Serif) - Classic, authoritative, almost inscription-like.
- **Body**: **Space Grotesk** (Sans-Serif) - Tech-inspired, quirky, modern.
- **Mono**: **JetBrains Mono** for data points or technical specs.

## Selected Design Direction: **Biophilic Brutalism**

I have chosen **Biophilic Brutalism** as the design direction. This approach perfectly aligns with the brand's core identity of "India-first," "Nature," and "Resonance."

**Why this choice?**
1.  **Alignment with Brand**: The "7.83Hz" concept is about grounding and Earth's heartbeat. A design that emphasizes raw textures, organic rhythms, and deep, earthy colors reinforces this grounding effect better than a sterile minimalist or high-tech look.
2.  **Differentiation**: Most wellness sites go for "Ethereal Minimalism" (light, airy, pastel). "Biophilic Brutalism" offers a stronger, more memorable, and premium identity that feels authentic to the rugged, ancient nature of the Indian landscape (Coorg, Wayanad, Himalayas).
3.  **Emotional Impact**: The use of deep greens and warm earth tones creates an immediate sense of calm and "digital detox," which is a key offering of the retreats.
4.  **Scalability**: The modular, asymmetric layout allows for rich storytelling and easy addition of new retreat types without breaking a rigid grid.

**Implementation Strategy**:
-   **Colors**: Deep Forest Green (`#0a1f14`), Soft Sand (`#e6e2d3`), Terracotta (`#c75b39`).
-   **Typography**: Cormorant Garamond (Headings) + Satoshi (Body).
-   **Visuals**: High-quality nature photography mixed with subtle grain textures and organic line art.
-   **Feel**: Grounded, slow, rhythmic, premium.
